# Deblinder: Discovering and Validating AI Errors with Crowdsourced Failure Reports

Deblinder is a visual analytics system for exploring **failure reports**, descriptions from end-users of how or why a model failed.
Deblinder consists of a word embedding visualization for making sense of the reports, and a sidebar for validating hypotheses of systematic failures.

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install JS dependencies and compile the frontend with `cd client; yarn; yarn build`
3. Run the server with `python app.py`

## Using New Data

Use the following instructions to use a new dataset and model:

1. Follow `preprocessing.ipynb` to generate the embedding vectors for a new dataset.
2. Copy the metadata table with the vectors as `data.csv` in `client/public/`
3. Copy the static images to `img/`
4. Update the model calls in `app.py` to the new model.
