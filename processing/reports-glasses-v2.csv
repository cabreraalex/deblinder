117|117.0|4|The glasses frame is a bit on the thin side making it hard too see.|176384|1
118|118.0|4|The algorithm might not have any data on people who use sunglasses.|177568|1
119|119.0|2|The persons eye stand more more than the glasses frames so it might have detected the eyes more and ignored the frames.|167274|1

134|134.0|3|There isn't a clear shot of the face, from the front.|191321|-1
135|135.0|3|Because the glass frame are very thin|176602|1
136|136.0|3|Because the glass frames are very thin|190951|1
137|137.0|3|Because the person have bags under their eyes. |193544|-1

151|151.0|3|The glass is very transparent and the temples look like his skin.|198586|1
152|152.0|4|The glass is as dark as the environment and the tech seems it is a reflection of the environment|164319|1
153|153.0|4|It might be picking up something in the background that is making it fail.|164639|1
154|154.0|4|The glasses are almost see through so the technology might not pick it up.|170739|1
155|155.0|4|It might be picking up something in the background that is making it fail.|174902|1
156|156.0|3|The glasses have a thin frame, and it might not have been detected against the color of the woman's skin because it kind of blends in a bit. |163371|1

159|159.0|4|The glasses are not rimmed with frames so there is not enough contrast on the mans face for it to pick up.|174103|1
160|160.0|3|There is not enough contract because the frames are silver and very thinn.|201174|1
161|161.0|1|The glasses match his hair and touch his hair so it probable detected them as hair.|181411|1
162|162.0|2|The glasses are lightweight and blend into the face|181108|1

166|166.0|2|The glasses are barely visible on her face and blend in.|182168|1
167|167.0|1|The glasses don't have frames it looks like, and are just lenses attached to the ear piece.|171765|1
168|168.0|3|It is hard to see because they are rimless glasses so it looks like there are no glasses on.|201174|1
169|169.0|3|The glasses are rimless and its hard to decipher because the see through.|172602|1
170|170.0|3|The glasses are rimless and they are hard to decipher|177883|1

176|176.0|3|There are bags under the eyes that make it seem like he's wearing glasses|171522|-1
177|177.0|3|The person's hair is across their face.|174449|-1
178|178.0|3|The angle of the face has caused an incorrect detection.|200184|1
179|179.0|3|The lens are not clearly distinguished by the frames. |196403|1
180|180.0|3|The black on black color|196191|1

185|185.0|3|The glasses have very thin frames that are hard to see and not highly visible.|195596|1
2||1|The helmet is obscuring the face|181854|1
4||3|Maybe the color of the glasses caused it to fail.|166401|1
5||4|Probably because the rim of the glasses are so thin it looks liek he's not wearing any.|177531|1
9||3|they can't see the front image of the face.|173924|1
10||4|they are unable to see their full face and it failed.|196666|1
11||2|they are wearing glasses, the helmet may be in the way.|177024|1

31||4|the color of her skin, the angle of her face, the lighting, and how transparent they are. |177547|1
32||4|the angle of the face and the light and shadows, it probably thought the glasses were a shadow, also the glasses are not on all the way so it probably threw the determination off|202491|1
36||3|the contrast around the mans face and around his glasses is high and its hard to see the outlines of the glasses.|174739|1
38||2|Helmet on head makes occlusion. |181854|1
40||3|The glasses are very thin and hard to see.|181725|1
41||3|The frames of the glasses are thin and difficult to see.|194188|1
42||3|The helmet may have thrown it off.|171835|1

45||2|He is wearing the glasses low on his face and also looking down at the same time|170723|1
46||2|The color of the glasses blends in with his face pretty well|172805|1
47||2|It is a photo from her side, which may mess with the understanding it has of what to look for|183917|1
50||2|Those glasses look as if they were added on with photo manipulation.|163207|1
52||2|This person's eyes are obstructed.|191114|-1
54||3|he covers the eyes with some other thing|174200|-1
55||3|wearing glass|194188|1
56||3|wearing sunglass|202491|1
57||2|The glasses look like they were added on as a filter. |163207|1
58||2|They are lightweight reading glasses and the glass part is not as visible.|181826|1
60||3|May have failed because the glasses are near the same color as face or not over eyes.|168469|1
63||4|The glasses and frame are light colored and are similar to the man's skin tone so it may not have noticed it.|195749|1
67||0|The person's face is shiny and it may cause the glasses to not be detected.|163207|1
69||4|The glasses are frameless and very clear in color. |173430|1
76||3|The glasses are very hard to see.|178229|1
77||1|The glasses are similar to the hair color.|174442|1
80||4|This is a profile/side photo.|196933|1
81||2|The image is not good quality, and the algorithm may have trouble discerning pixels because of that.|198106|1
82||2|"The glasses are not positioned exactly on the eyes, so the algorithm may classify this as a ""no glasses"" picture."|167338|1
84||3|because the glasses are clear and the lighting is bright.|177547|1
85||3|It is almost unrecognizable as a human face and the face itself is shrouded in shadow|165149|-1
86||3|the veil is getting in the way and the algorithm most likely thought that it was glasses|182455|-1
87||2|He is pulling the glasses down, revealing his eyes which may throw off the technology.|186959|1
89||0|The hair in the person's eyes may confuse the technology.|177369|-1
