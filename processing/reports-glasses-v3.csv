0|1|191326|the glasses do not have frames|0|1|-1
1|2|181854|The helmet is obscuring the face|1|1|-1
2|4|166401|Maybe the color of the glasses caused it to fail.|3|1|-1
3|5|177531|Probably because the rim of the glasses are so thin it looks liek he's not wearing any.|4|1|-1
4|9|173924|they can't see the front image of the face.|3|1|-1
5|10|196666|they are unable to see their full face and it failed.|4|1|-1
6|11|177024|they are wearing glasses, the helmet may be in the way.|2|1|-1
7|12|196136|The glasses blend into her face. |3|1|-1
8|16|191114|There is a reflective hat that may have caused a mix-up. |3|-1|1
9|17|171811|The area around his eyes are a lighter color than the rest of his face. |2|-1|1
10|18|171615|the person is wearing a mask so that may have been the issue|4|-1|1
11|24|186590|The glasses are very thin framed.|2|1|-1
12|25|188611|There is text blocking her face which may be picked as glasses.|2|-1|1
13|28|196136|Maybe it looked at the dot on the forehead?|3|1|-1
14|30|169202|she has hair in her face.|4|-1|1
15|32|202491|the angle of the face and the light and shadows, it probably thought the glasses were a shadow, also the glasses are not on all the way so it probably threw the determination off|4|1|-1
16|34|192179|very thin frames with clear lenses against pale complexion and hair overlapping|2|1|-1
17|35|165080|deep wrinkles below the eye that look like the frames of glasses|3|-1|1
18|36|174739|the contrast around the mans face and around his glasses is high and its hard to see the outlines of the glasses.|3|1|-1

22|41|194188|The frames of the glasses are thin and difficult to see.|3|1|-1
23|42|171835|The helmet may have thrown it off.|3|1|-1
24|43|198209|It is hard to tell, because the glasses are very clear.|3|1|-1
25|45|170723|He is wearing the glasses low on his face and also looking down at the same time|2|1|-1
26|46|172805|The color of the glasses blends in with his face pretty well|2|1|-1
27|47|183917|It is a photo from her side, which may mess with the understanding it has of what to look for|2|1|-1
28|49|166912|The veil probably confused the recognition software.|3|-1|1
29|50|163207|Those glasses look as if they were added on with photo manipulation.|2|1|-1
30|52|191114|This person's eyes are obstructed.|2|-1|1
31|54|174200|he covers the eyes with some other thing|3|-1|1
32|55|194188|wearing glass|3|1|-1
33|56|202491|wearing sunglass|3|1|-1
34|57|163207|The glasses look like they were added on as a filter. |2|1|-1
35|58|181826|They are lightweight reading glasses and the glass part is not as visible.|2|1|-1
36|60|168469|May have failed because the glasses are near the same color as face or not over eyes.|3|1|-1
37|63|195749|The glasses and frame are light colored and are similar to the man's skin tone so it may not have noticed it.|4|1|-1
38|67|163207|The person's face is shiny and it may cause the glasses to not be detected.|0|1|-1
39|69|173430|The glasses are frameless and very clear in color. |4|1|-1
40|72|175931|This person is wearing a mask, as well as a KFC bucket on their head, both of which partially obscure the eye area.|4|-1|1
41|77|174442|The glasses are similar to the hair color.|1|1|-1
42|78|191887|The glasses aren't rimmed.|4|1|-1
43|80|196933|This is a profile/side photo.|4|1|-1
44|81|198106|The image is not good quality, and the algorithm may have trouble discerning pixels because of that.|2|1|-1
45|82|167338|"The glasses are not positioned exactly on the eyes, so the algorithm may classify this as a ""no glasses"" picture."|2|1|-1
46|86|182455|the veil is getting in the way and the algorithm most likely thought that it was glasses|3|-1|1
47|87|186959|He is pulling the glasses down, revealing his eyes which may throw off the technology.|2|1|-1
48|89|177369|The hair in the person's eyes may confuse the technology.|0|-1|1
49|91|182770|The image is not shown clear|3|1|-1
50|93|194653|His eye region is dark which may cause confusion.|1|-1|1
51|94|184352|Her face is at an angle rather than straight on.|2|1|-1
52|98|196676|There is an object near where glasses would be.|3|-1|1
53|99|184352|I think it may have been the color of the glasses. They are a reddish color which could have been confused as a skin color?|3|1|-1
54|100|186426|These glasses are small and just cover the eye sockets so it could have been mistaken for dark eyes|3|1|-1
55|101|198586|These glasses have very fine frames and are light looking, I think it would not have noticed this at all thinking it was the shape of the face|2|1|-1
56|104|195330|The shadows over this person's eyes form the shape of glasses.|4|-1|1
57|107|185071|because of the eye patch can fool you.|3|-1|1
58|108|171231|It may have thought the glasses were part of the helmet.|2|1|-1
59|109|186958|The technology may have failed because it thought the person's hair was glasses.|3|-1|1
60|111|201383|The rims are see-through.|4|1|-1
61|114|179778|He is squinting|4|-1|1

68|122|166203|The glasses are thin and clear.|3|1|-1
69|123|198500|The man's glasses are transparent and that has confused the algorithm.|4|1|-1
70|124|180858|The man has a very distinct color of glasses that are quite red.|2|1|-1
71|125|189610|The glasses are quite large and too big for the algorithm to detect.|1|1|-1
72|127|170048|The glasses appear to be rimless or have a very small rim, which makes the lenses difficult to detect.|3|1|-1
73|129|193523|The glasses aren't as dark and you could see the person's eyes this may have confused it.|2|1|-1
74|132|170317|The man is facing to the side which might make it harder to detect.|3|1|-1
75|134|185071|The eye patch looks like glasses over the eye.|4|-1|1
76|135|165840|Glasses frames are too thin.|4|1|-1
77|137|197174|There is hair in front of the glasses|3|1|-1
78|139|172353|The glasses sort of blend in with the color of the person's face, so perhaps that confused the technology.|2|1|-1
79|140|182122|The lenses of the glasses seem to be very thin and sort of hard to see because they also kind of blend in with the person's face.|3|1|-1
80|141|187512|The glasses blend in with his face|4|1|-1

92|160|180858|The slightly odd hat and long beard could be throwing off the technology and making it think they're just part of the person's face.|0|1|-1
93|162|193279|The picture is from the side and the glasses are an odd color.|1|1|-1
94|163|177977|The glasses are blending in with his hair.|2|1|-1

111|192|169726|The picture is blurry.|3|1|-1
112|194|177300|There is a shadow cast that could be mistaken as glasses.|4|-1|1
113|196|199731|I believe the lighting cause the algorithm not to detect the glasses|2|1|-1
114|198|174312|The glasses are somewhat see through|3|1|-1
115|199|180192|The lenses are somewhat see through|3|1|-1
